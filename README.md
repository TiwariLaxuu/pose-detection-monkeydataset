The objective of this challenge is to detect the 2D coordinates of the landmarks on the non-human primate (NHP) images in the wild. Recently years have been seen great advances in systems that can track major landmarks in moving animals without fiducial markers, that is, pose. Such tracking systems have greatly benefited research in fields that study the tracked species (e.g., rodents, flies, and fishes). Non-human primates remain of great interest in biomedicine and related fields, including in neuroscience and psychology, as well as in anthropology, epidemiology, and ecology. Automated tracking can also benefit animal welfare programs, veterinary medical practice, and, indeed, conservation projects.


Our OpenMonkeyChallenge dataset is composed of 111,529 annotated images of NHPs (26 species), obtained from the internet, three National Primate Research Centers, and the Minnesota Zoo. 17 landmarks are annotated for each image, including Nose, Left eye, Right eye, Head, Neck, Left shoulder, Left elbow, Left wrist, Right shoulder, Right elbow, Right wrist, Hip, Left knee, Left ankle, Right knee, Right ankle, and Tail.
